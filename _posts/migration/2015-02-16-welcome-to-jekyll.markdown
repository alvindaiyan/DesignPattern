Hi, my friend. My name is Yan Dai, from China. Currently, I'm living in New Zealand. My current job is [Java Developer][jd] at [Syl Semantics][syl]. Syl is a company providing services about information management including searching and discovering. My job is about delivering all [SDLC][sdlc] required activities.

Here, I would like to share some of my understanding and why I choose working with Java. Java is a great language. Java is the programming language that has robusted and sophisticated design to obtain [Object-oriented paradigm][oo]. Also, Java has one of the most attractive feature that is cross platform support because it runs on [JVM][jvm]. Of course, the eco-system of JVM and Java is great, though I may talk about them separately. A large number of open-source library built on Java can be found everywhere. To my best knowledge, Java can provide all kinds solutions to any software related problem. Such as SSH (Structs + Spring + Hibernate) is great for developing a mid to large web application. As a developer, IDE is very important for daily productivity. There are numbers of great IDE on the market and the best thing is that majority of them are free! Currently, [Intellij][intellij] is my first choice, and besides I also like working on [Eclipse][eclipse]. As Java is needed to compiled to bytecode to run on JVM, a great tool is required. Long time ago, all I learned about Java from school is build by [apache Ant][ant]. Now, [apache Maven][maven] has become a major approach for building Java project. There are too many advantages of using Java, therefore Java is one of my favourite programming language. 

Besides Java, [Go][golang] is the other favourite programming language of mine. The reason is simple, Go's grammar is simple but powerful. Go is one of the best programming language to solve concurrent problem on program language level. The other famous one is [Erlang][erlang]. I don't know much about Erlang. But by reading from Internet, Erlang is way difficult to learn compared with Go.

For my life, I like playing soccer. I has been playing soccer since I was five. Though I don't think I'm good player still even I can get some goals:) My favourite soccer team is Real Mardrid and favourite player is [David Silva][davidsilva].

To every reader of my blog, I want to appologise that I'm not a great writer. English is not my native language. I believe that you will find a lot of grammar errors in my post. Please don't be hesitated to point them out to help me improve. Thanks alot:)
