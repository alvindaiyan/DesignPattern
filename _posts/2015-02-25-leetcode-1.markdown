Recently, when I played on LeetCode.com, there is a solution for a question is really beautiful. 
In this post, I want to present this solution.

The [question]() is:

![leetcode]({{ site.url }}/assets/leetcode.png)

The solution is: 

{% highlight java %}
public int singleNumber(int[] A) {
    int result = 0; 
    for (int i : A) result ^= i ; 
    return result ; 
} 
{% endhighlight %}
